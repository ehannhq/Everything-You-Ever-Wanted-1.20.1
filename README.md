# Everything and Anything (Forge 1.20.1)

I barely know anything about Minecraft Modding, and I only have
one semester's worth of AP Computer Science A. So, if the code or mod 
itself is very inefficient, bear with me.

Why am I on GitHub? Because I want to work on my laptop and my PC, as well as to serve 
as a backup.

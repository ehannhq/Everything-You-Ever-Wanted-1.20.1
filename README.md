# Everything and Anything (Forge 1.20.1)

I barely know anything about Minecraft Modding, and I only have
one semester's worth of AP Computer Science A. So, if the code or mod 
itself is very inefficient, bear with me.

Why am I on GitHub? Because I want to work on my laptop and my PC, as well as to serve 
as a backup.

## What is _Everything and Anything_?

A Minecraft 1.20.1 Forge mod that adds what (I) you truly wanted in Minecraft. From
upgradable tridents, shields and elytras, to an entirely new Armor/Tool set 
that's inspired by The End, to giving underappreciated blocks/items a new 
purpose/meaning, to gag items that makes no sense into why its in Minecraft.
This mod keeps to true Vanilla minecraft, but maybe in the future it will expand
into something, big.

# Everything You Ever Wanted (in a) Mod (Forge 1.20.1)

I barely know anything about Minecraft Modding, as well as I only have
one semesters worth of AP Computer Science A. So, if the code or mod 
itself is very inefficient, bare with me.

Why am I on github? Because I want to work on my laptop and my PC.
